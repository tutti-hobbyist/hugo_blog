## 面接対策
### General

    >
    -

### Behavioral
1. How would you handle a situation where you have a different opinion from your manager, tech lead, or teammates?
    > Make the impression that you are flexible in discussion, listening to other opinions, compromising if necessary.
   - When differences arise, my focus is on aligning interests and ensuring we are all working toward the same goal. I would begin by facilitating a discussion where each party can identify the points of disagreement and explore the underlying causes for the discrepancy. My aim would be to find a compromise or solution that addresses everyone's concerns while staying aligned with our overall objectives. If needed, I would have 1-on-1 meetings with any individuals who remain unconvinced to better understand their perspective and work together to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.

2. What is your strength and weakness? Can you give some examples?
    > For strength, 1.) choose a strength that aligns with the role, 2) show how you’ve used this strength in a past experience and 3.) explain how this strength will benefit the company. For weakness, 1.) choose something that is not a critical flaw for the job, but still a real area for improvement. It's significant to show how you are working on improving it.
    - One of my strengths is the ability to solve complex problems. In my previous role at xxx, I was working on a project that encountered several technical challenges with xxx. I took the initiative to analyze the root cause, researched possible solutions, and collaborated with my team to implement a successful fix. As a result, we improved the system’s performance by 30%. I believe this strength would allow me to contribute effectively to solving challenges at xxx. On the other hand, one of my weaknesses has been public speaking. Earlier in my career, I found it challenging to present in front of large groups. However, I recognized this as an important skill, so I started taking small steps to improve, like attending workshops and volunteering for presentations at team meetings. Over time, I’ve become more comfortable with public speaking while I still have room for improvement. I’m continuing to work on this skill to be much more confident.
